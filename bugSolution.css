The `calc()` function requires proper syntax.  Make sure operators (+, -, *, /) are used correctly and that units are consistent. Spaces around operators are recommended.  Ensure you're not using nested `calc()` improperly. 

Example of corrected CSS:
```css
.box {
  width: calc(100% - 20px);
  height: calc(50vw + 10px);
}
```
